This list is promptly passed on to the 'save_metadata' function, which interprets these objects, and saves a dataframe to a .csv file. This operation is repeatable, and will never overwrite previously collected data. As such, you have the option of running the cell below multiple times, without fear of loose metadata files, or losing access to already downloaded images. "

Since the download is very slow on the network IO side, this is done using multiple threads, for a big performance boost. It can still be rather slow, as some images are very large.

ISIC is not endless, and some diagnosis have more images than others. If one diagnosis has no more images, no more images will be downloaded. The program will still attempt to reach the goal for each diagnosis separately though, so if you ask for 5000, and there are 5000, you should get pretty close to 5000 (some images lack basic metadata, such as age or gender, and as such are not downloaded at all, bringing the total down by a few images on occasion)."
